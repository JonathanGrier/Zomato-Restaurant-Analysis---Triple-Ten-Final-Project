# Zomato-Restaurant-Analysis---Triple-Ten-Final-Project
This project analyzes restaurant data from the Zomato platform to uncover insights into popularity, revenue performance, and key success factors. Using tools like Tableau and Excel, I created a data-driven framework to evaluate both major chains and single-location restaurants across multiple cities.

Objectives:

Identify the most popular restaurants on the platform

Analyze which restaurants generate the highest revenue

Discover what makes top restaurants stand out

Understand how city and cuisine type impact restaurant success

 Tools Used:
 
Tableau (Data Visualization & Dashboards)

Excel (Data Cleaning & Currency Conversion)

Zomato Dataset (Orders, Ratings, Revenue, Cuisines)

 Key Insights:
 
Bigger isn’t always better: Several single-location restaurants outperformed major brands in popularity and revenue.

Customer experience drives success: High ratings and consistent service strongly correlate with higher revenue.

Local market knowledge matters: Cuisine preferences and city-specific trends significantly impact performance.

Zomato expands reach: Many successful restaurants leverage the platform to grow beyond their physical locations.

 Popularity Score:
 
I created a composite popularity score based on:

Total Orders (60% weight)

Total Revenue (30% weight)

Average Rating × 10 (10% weight)

This score helped surface restaurants that performed well across all metrics, not just one.

 What I Learned:
 
How to blend quantitative metrics with business context

How to use weighted scores to evaluate performance fairly

How to structure and present a clear, visually driven story
